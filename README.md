# 3D Portfolio Website

Welcome to my 3D Portfolio Website, a showcase of my skills and projects in the field of 3D modeling, animation, and interactive experiences. This website is built using cutting-edge technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Vite, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Explore my 3D models in a fully interactive environment, allowing you to rotate, zoom, and pan through each project.
- **Real-time Audio Control**: Seamlessly control audio playback and volume directly within the 3D environment.
- **Responsive Design**: Enjoy a consistent and optimized experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **TypeScript and ESLint Integration**: Ensuring code quality, type safety, and best practices throughout the project.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Utilized for building the user interface and managing state changes.
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for type safety, code maintainability, and scalability.
- **React-three-fibre**: Implemented for Making 3D Envrioemnet.
- **React-three-drei**:Implemented for Making 3D Envrioemnet Functionality.
- **Vite**: Chosen for its fast development cycle, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds.
- **ESLint**: Configured for code quality and type checking, ensuring adherence to best practices and coding standards.

## Development Insights

- **Vite Plugins**: Utilized official Vite plugins for React development, including [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) and [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc).
- **ESLint Configuration**: Extended to include type-aware lint rules for enhanced code quality and type checking.
